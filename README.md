# TorcProject

This is my `take home` assessment project for `Torc`. Taking from the requirements, this program should read an input file containing line entries. Each line entry describes a type of good. Each line begins with the amount of the merchandise, then contains words that describe the good and ends with the price of the item.

The item should be processed for taxation based on certain rules, if the good is either a book, a medicine, or food it is excempt from taxation. Additional, if the item is imported, it is subject to `Import duty` regardless of the basic taxation.

## Installation
